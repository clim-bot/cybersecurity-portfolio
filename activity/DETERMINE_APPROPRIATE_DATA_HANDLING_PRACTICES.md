## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will review the results of a data risk assessment. You will determine whether effective data handling processes are being implemented to protect information privacy.

Data is among the most valuable assets in the world today. Everything from intellectual property to guest WiFi networks should be protected with a combination of technical, operational, and managerial controls. Implementing the principle of least privilege is essential to protect information privacy.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.

## Scenario

Review the following scenario. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You work for an educational technology company that developed an application to help teachers automatically grade assignments. The application handles a wide range of data that it collects from academic institutions, instructors, parents, and students.

Your team was alerted to a data leak of internal business plans on social media. An investigation by the team discovered that an employee accidentally shared those confidential documents with an external business partner. An audit into the leak is underway to determine how similar incidents can be avoided.

A supervisor provided you with information regarding the leak. It appears that the principle of least privilege was not observed by employees at the company during a sales meeting. You have been asked to analyze the situation and find ways to prevent it from happening again.

First, you'll need to evaluate details about the incident. Then, you'll review the controls in place to prevent data leaks. Next, you'll identify ways to improve information privacy at the company. Finally, you'll justify why you think your recommendations will make data handling at the company more secure.

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation
**Issue(s) row:**  
The data leak occurred due to a manager failing to unshare a folder of internal documents after a meeting. Additionally, a sales representative mistakenly shared a link to the entire folder, bypassing intended controls, and the business partner unknowingly publicized the link.

### Step 3: Review Current Data Privacy Controls
**Review row:**  
NIST SP 800-53: AC-6 focuses on enforcing the principle of least privilege, ensuring users only have the access necessary for their tasks. It emphasizes restricting access based on roles, revoking access automatically, maintaining logs, and auditing privileges regularly to minimize risks.

---

### Step 4: Identify Control Enhancements
**Recommendation(s) row:**  
1. Implement automatic revocation of access to shared folders after a specified time.  
2. Regularly audit user permissions to ensure access is limited to essential tasks and roles.

---

### Step 5: Justify Your Recommendations
**Justification row:**  
Automatic revocation ensures shared access is temporary, reducing the risk of accidental exposure. Regular audits help identify and address unnecessary privileges, ensuring only authorized users have access. These measures reduce human error and improve adherence to the principle of least privilege.
