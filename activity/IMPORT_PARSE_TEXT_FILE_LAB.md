# Import and parse a text file

## Introduction
Security logs are often stored in text files. To analyze the security logs in these files, security analysts have to import and parse these files. Python has some functions that come in handy for these tasks, allowing analysts to efficiently access information from text files.

In this lab, you'll practice using functions and other syntax in Python to import and parse text files.

**Note**: Have you already completed this lab once? Due to how Coursera handles files, you will need to reset the `data/login.txt` file used in this lab to its original contents if you want to complete this lab more than once. The File contents reset section at the end of this notebook contains code that allows you to reset the `data/login.txt` file to its original contents. After you have run the code in that section, you can begin the lab again.

## Tips for completing this lab

### Scenario
In this lab, you're working as a security analyst. You're responsible for preparing a security log file for analysis and creating a text file with IP addresses that are allowed to access restricted information.

---

## Task 1
In this task, you'll import a security log text file and store it as a string to prepare it for analysis.

In Python, a `with` statement is often used in file handling to open a file and then automatically close the file after reading it.

You're given a variable named `import_file` that contains the name of the log file that you want to import. Start by writing the first line of the `with` statement in the following code cell. Use the `open()` function, setting the second parameter to `"r"`. Note that running this code will produce an error because it will only contain the first line of the `with` statement; you'll complete this `with` statement in the task after this. Be sure to replace the `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code.

```python
# Assign `import_file` to the name of the text file that contains the security log file
import_file = "data/login.txt"

# First line of the `with` statement
# Use `open()` to import security log file and store it as a string
with open(import_file, "r") as file:
```

---

## Task 2
Now, you'll use the `.read()` method to read the imported file, and you'll store the result in a variable named `text`. Afterwards, display the text and explore what it contains by running the cell. Be sure to replace the `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code before you run the following cell.

```python
# Assign `import_file` to the name of the text file that contains the security log file
import_file = "data/login.txt"

# The`with` statement
# Use `open()` to import security log file and store it as a string
with open(import_file, "r") as file:
    # Use `.read()` to read the imported file and store the result in a variable named `text`
    text = file.read()

# Display the contents of `text`
print(text)
```

---

## Task 3
The output in the previous step is one big string. In this task, you'll explore how you can split the string that contains the entire imported log file into a list of strings, one string per line.

Use the `.split()` method to perform this split and then display the result. Be sure to replace the `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code before you run the following cell.

Note that displaying `.split()` doesnâ€™t change what is stored in the text variable. Variable reassignment would be necessary if you want to store the result after splitting.

```python
# Assign `import_file` to the name of the text file that contains the security log file
import_file = "data/login.txt"

# The`with` statement
# Use `open()` to import security log file and store it as a string
with open(import_file, "r") as file:
    # Use `.read()` to read the imported file and store the result in a variable named `text`
    text = file.read()

# Display the contents of `text` split into separate lines 
print(text.split())
```

**Question 1**  
What do you notice about the output before and after using the `.split()` method?

Before using the `.split()` method, the output is one long string containing all of the lines from the log file. After using the `.split()` method, the output is a list of strings; each string corresponds to a line from the log file.

---

## Task 4
There is a missing entry in the log file. You'll need to account for that by appending it to the log file. You're given the missing entry stored in a variable named `missing_entry`.

Use the `.write()` method and the parameter `"a"` in the `open()` function. Be sure to replace each `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code before you run the following cell.

After the portion of the code that writes to the file, another `with` statement uses the `.read()` method to read the updated file into the `text` variable and then display it.

```python
# Assign `import_file` to the name of the text file that contains the security log file
import_file = "data/login.txt"

# Assign `missing_entry` to a log that was not recorded in the log file
missing_entry = "jrafael,192.168.243.140,4:56:27,2022-05-09"

# Use `open()` to import security log file and store it as a string
# Pass in "a" as the second parameter to indicate that the file is being opened for appending purposes
with open(import_file, "a") as file:
    # Use `.write()` to append `missing_entry` to the log file
    file.write(missing_entry)

# Use `open()` with the parameter "r" to open the security log file for reading purposes
with open(import_file, "r") as file:
    # Use `.read()` to read in the contents of the log file and store in a variable named `text`
    text = file.read()

# Display the contents of `text`
print(text)
```

**Question 2**  
What do you notice about the position of the entry that was added to the log file?

The additional entry was added to the end of the log file, so it appears in the last line of the output.

## Task 5
The next task you're responsible for is creating a text file. This text file should include a list of IP addresses that are allowed to access restricted information. Documenting this in a text file will help you communicate your findings to your security team.

Start by creating a variable named `import_file` that stores the name of the file, which should be `"allow_list.txt"`.

You're also given a variable named `ip_addresses` that stores a string containing the IP addresses that are allowed.

Run the code to display the two variables and explore what they contain. Be sure to replace the `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code before you run the following cell.

```python
# Assign `import_file` to the name of the text file that you want to create
import_file = "data/allow_list.txt"

# Assign `ip_addresses` to a list of IP addresses that are allowed to access the restricted information
ip_addresses = "192.168.218.160 192.168.97.225 192.168.145.158 192.168.108.13 192.168.60.153 192.168.96.200 192.168.247.153 192.168.3.252 192.168.116.187 192.168.15.110 192.168.39.246"

# Display `import_file`
print(import_file)

# Display `ip_addresses`
print(ip_addresses)
```

---

## Task 6
Your next goal is to create a `with` statement in order to write the IP addresses to the text file you created in the previous step.

You'll first open the file using the `"w"` parameter. Then, you'll write the IP addresses to the file. Be sure to replace each `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code before you run the following cell.

```python
# Assign `import_file` to the name of the text file that you want to create
import_file = "data/allow_list.txt"

# Assign `ip_addresses` to a list of IP addresses that are allowed to access the restricted information
ip_addresses = "192.168.218.160 192.168.97.225 192.168.145.158 192.168.108.13 192.168.60.153 192.168.96.200 192.168.247.153 192.168.3.252 192.168.116.187 192.168.15.110 192.168.39.246"

# Create a `with` statement to write to the text file 
with open(import_file, "w") as file:
    # Write `ip_addresses` to the text file
    file.write(ip_addresses)
```

---

## Task 7
In this final step, you'll complete the code you've been writing up to this point. You'll add code to read the file containing IP addresses.

Complete a `with` statement that reads the text file and stores it in a new variable called `text`.

Afterwards, display the contents of `text` and run the cell to explore the result. Be sure to replace each `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` with your own code before you run the following cell.

```python
# Assign `import_file` to the name of the text file that you want to create
import_file = "data/allow_list.txt"

# Assign `ip_addresses` to a list of IP addresses that are allowed to access the restricted information
ip_addresses = "192.168.218.160 192.168.97.225 192.168.145.158 192.168.108.13 192.168.60.153 192.168.96.200 192.168.247.153 192.168.3.252 192.168.116.187 192.168.15.110 192.168.39.246"

# Create a `with` statement to write to the text file 
with open(import_file, "w") as file:
    # Write `ip_addresses` to the text file
    file.write(ip_addresses)

# Create a `with` statement to read in the text file 
with open(import_file, "r") as file:
    # Read the file and store the result in a variable named `text`
    text = file.read()

# Display the contents of `text`
print(text)
```
