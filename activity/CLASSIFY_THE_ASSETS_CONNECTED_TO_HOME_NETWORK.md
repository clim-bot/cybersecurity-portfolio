## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will classify assets connected to a home office network.

Asset management is a critical part of every organization's security plan. Remember that asset management is the process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them. Effective asset management starts with creating an asset inventory, or a catalog of assets that need to be protected. Then, it involves classifying assets based on their level of importance and sensitivity to risk.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. 

## Scenario

Review the following scenario. Then, complete the step-by-step instructions.

One of the most valuable assets in the world today is information. Most information is accessed over a network. There tend to be a variety of devices connected to a network and each is a potential entry point to other assets.

An inventory of network devices can be a useful asset management tool. An inventory can highlight sensitive assets that require extra protection.

You’re operating a small business from your home and must create an inventory of your network devices. This will help you determine which ones contain sensitive information that require extra protection.

To do this, you will start by identifying three devices that have access to your home network. This might include devices such as:

Desktop or laptop computers

Smartphones

Smart home devices

Game consoles

Storage devices or servers

Video streaming devices

Then, you’ll list important characteristics of each device such as its owner, location, and type. Finally, you will assign each device a level of sensitivity based on how important it is to protect.

### Step 3: Fill in the Characteristics of Each Asset

### **Asset: Smart TV**  
- **Network Access**: Intermittent (connects only when streaming content)  
- **Owner**: John (primary user of the TV in the household)  
- **Location**: Living Room (near the router)

### **Asset: External Hard Drive**  
- **Network Access**: None (not directly connected to the network)  
- **Owner**: Mary (stores business backups)  
- **Location**: Home Office  

### **Asset: Smartphone**  
- **Network Access**: Continuous (connected 24/7 via WiFi)  
- **Owner**: Jane (family member with social media accounts and personal data stored)  
- **Location**: Bedroom (typically carried everywhere)

### Step 4: Evaluate the Access of Network Devices

### **Notes for Each Device**:  

1. **Smart TV**:  
   - Connects via WiFi for streaming apps.  
   - Limited sensitive data, but it has access to accounts with stored payment information.  

2. **External Hard Drive**:  
   - Contains sensitive business data, including financial reports and customer records.  
   - No direct network connection reduces hacking risks but increases physical theft risk.  

3. **Smartphone**:  
   - Stores personal data, emails, and banking apps.  
   - Frequent online activity makes it a potential target for phishing or malware.

### Step 5: Classify the Sensitivity of Network Devices

### **Sensitivity Classification**:
1. **Smart TV**: Low  
   - Limited sensitive data; mainly used for streaming purposes.  

2. **External Hard Drive**: Confidential  
   - Contains highly sensitive business data that could significantly impact operations if compromised.  

3. **Smartphone**: Moderate  
   - Stores personal data and financial information, making it a moderate risk if compromised.
