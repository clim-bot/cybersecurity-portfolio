# USB Baiting Exercise

## Contents
The USB drive contains both personal and work-related files, including family and pet photos, a new hire letter, employee shift schedules, an annual budget tracker, and Jorge's resume. This mix of information includes personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive workplace documents, which could be exploited by attackers to harm Jorge or compromise the hospital's operations.

## Attacker Mindset
An attacker could use the PII and work files to impersonate Jorge, steal sensitive information, or gain unauthorized access to hospital systems. Files like the shift schedule and new hire letter could help an attacker target specific employees or develop phishing schemes. This USB could also have been intentionally placed to establish a backdoor into the hospitalâ€™s systems.

## Risk Analysis
USB baiting attacks can deliver malware like ransomware, spyware, or keyloggers. If the device were infected, it could compromise sensitive hospital systems, exposing confidential employee or patient information. To mitigate such risks, organizations should train employees to avoid plugging in unknown USB devices, enforce policies on separating personal and work drives, and deploy virtualization software for secure inspection. Managerial controls like restricting USB port usage and using endpoint protection software can further prevent such attacks.
