## Question 1: Implementing a Security Solution

### Situation
While working as an intern, the organization lacked visibility into network traffic anomalies, increasing the risk of undetected threats.

### Task
I was tasked with creating a monitoring solution to detect unusual activities and improve response times.

### Action
I developed Splunk dashboards using existing logs to highlight anomalies in real time. I collaborated with the IT team to configure alerts for critical events and trained the staff to use the dashboards effectively.

### Result
This solution reduced incident response times by 20% and enabled early detection of two phishing attempts within the first month.

## Question 2: Responding to a Security Leak

### Situation
During my previous role, the organization faced a data breach that exposed sensitive customer information.

### Task
My responsibility was to investigate the breach, mitigate further risks, and ensure regulatory compliance while continuing daily operations.

### Action
I prioritized isolating the affected systems and identified the source of the breach through log analysis. Simultaneously, I coordinated with management to notify affected parties and implement immediate security patches. I delegated routine tasks to colleagues to maintain business continuity.

### Result
The breach was contained within two hours, mitigating additional exposure. Affected customers were informed promptly, and the organization passed a follow-up compliance audit with no penalties.
